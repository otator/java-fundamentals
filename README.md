## Lab_01

in this lab we practiced some main basics like loops, if statements and functions.

1. pluralize() is a mathod that takes two args <name, number>, and it returns the name as plural if the number is 0 or more than 1.

for testing -> call the method: `pluralize("cat",2);` and it must return something like: > **I own 2 cats.**

2. flipNHeads() is a method which takes a number as an argument as heads number, and since it simulates the flipping of coin, this method stop when the number of heads ocuur in a row equals its argument.

for testing -> call the method: `flipNHeads(3);` and it must return something like: **It took 13 flips to flip 3 heads in a row.**

3. clock() is a method that simulates digital clocks, it displays a new time increased by second each second infinately.


for testing -> call the method: `clock();` and it must return something like:

**17:54:17**

**17:54:18**

**17:54:19**

**.**

**.**
